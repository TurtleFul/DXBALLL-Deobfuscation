# dx-ball-Deobfuscation

Trying to deobfuscate dx-ball.ru 

DX-Ball (stylized as DX • BΔLL, sometimes also written as DXBALL) is a freeware computer game for the PC first released in 1996 by Michael P. Welch and Seumas McNally. 
The game, originally based on an earlier series of Amiga games known as MegaBall, is patterned after classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as Breakout and Arkanoid.

dx-ball.ru was a website that had remade DX-ball with JavaScript. However the site was obfuscated beond all recognition.

Tis repo contains my efforts to deobfuscate the game out of that website and make it playable in any webbrowser anywhere and maybe, in the future, moddable.
